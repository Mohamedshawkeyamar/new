            <p>Riyadh, originally known as Hajr, was founded by the Banu Hanifa tribe in pre-Islamic times. Serving as the capital of 
                Al-Yamamah, it was a vital trading hub in central Arabia during the Umayyad and Abbasid eras. In the 14th century, 
                traveler Ibn Battuta described Hajr as a city of canals and trees. By the 18th century, Riyadh emerged as a key settlement,
                 and in 1824, it became the capital of the Saud dynasty. The Masmak Fortress, built in 1865, played a pivotal role in 1902 
                 when King Abdulaziz Al Saud recaptured Riyadh, laying the foundation for modern Saudi Arabia. Diriyah, a UNESCO World Heritage
                  Site near Riyadh, showcases traditional Najdi architecture and remains a symbol of the kingdom’s heritage.</p>
